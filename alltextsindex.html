I'm glad you are celebrating spring.  We are doing likewise, but without the exercise (I need to rectify that). Ha! <br/>Like you, I'm also trying to make more time for my grandchildren.  I hadn't seen them since January and finally met them halfway, in Delafield, a couple of weekends ago.  How sad and the time was way too short!  Since Nicole is in her masters program, I don't see them as much as I used to but now that driving is becoming easier for me, I hope to get down to Racine on a regular basis.<br/>This Sunday, Paula, my daughter-in-law, got her Master's Degree from Edgewood.  It was a wonderful day!  I accessed your site to show Paula's parents, Czeslaw and Krystyna (here from Poland on a month-long visit), some of our family pictures.  They really enjoyed it!  They did notice that Brett and Paula are not on the site so I am attaching a couple of pictures.  I hope you have a chance to meet them.  They are incredible, warm people.  I feel like I've known them forever.  Even with the limited language (I like to think we have psychic translation i.e. body language) we seem to touch on the important things we have in common.<br/>Paula has two weeks off and I'm planning day trips for the following two weeks.  I'm thinking Mineral Point and Wollersheim Winery, we did Olbrich Gardens, the farmer's market and the Arboretum.  Any suggestions for local touring that doesn't require much English?  My Polish is progressing very slowly. Ha!  Their understanding of English is much better.  Are you guys up for a trip to Wollersheim?<br/>This week they are driving to Canada to visit relatives, and Dad and Mike are running up north to check out the house and do some fishing (hopefully, Mike keeps Dad out of the casino. Ha!).  When everyone is back, I would love to have you over.  I believe Mike and Dad will be back Memorial Day weekend (Mike mentioned going opposite the traffic).  Let me know what would be a good time to get together or when you won't be available.  That invitation goes out to everyone, by the way!<br/>Yesterday, we celebrated Kayla's 14th Birthday!  I can hardly believe it!  She is looking forward to West H.S. and has already started mapping out college strategies.  It helps having all her older siblings set such a good example.  She's an awsome kid!<br/>As to your questions about Dad, he is doing quite well.  Feisty even!  He asked Krystyna to leave her husband and marry him.  He says that with her cooking he'll live forever.  (She cooks like our grandma!)  He and Czeslaw were drinking piwo (beer) together and Dad was proud to show that he still remembers how to start grace in Polish (from the one year stint he and Aunt Anne did in Polish Catholic school).<br/>He still enjoys his books on tape and is now into a series of Andrew Greeley books, so be forwarned he likes to pick a topic and discuss. Ha!  I'm always looking for ways to keep him busy, but his declining vision makes it hard, as you are well aware of.  Even so, he does a lot of his own cooking and bakes incredible oatmeal raison cookies.  Thank you, thank you, Middleton VA Hospital for all the gadgets that make this possible!<br/>He is still shy about going to the senior center and talking to people.  I have to drag him there for special events but, when he gets there, he enjoys himself.<br/>As for me, physical therapy has done wonders for my head.  Who would have thought? Ha!  I've been enjoying the garden, getting on top of my house (not literally of course) and I'm starting to get out of my shell and be social again without going into a panic. Amen!<br/>Life is good!<br/>We are all doing very well and I hope you and yours are likewise!  I look forward to catching up with you!  Til then.....<br/>Take Care and God Bless!<br/>Love,<br/>Dianne<br/>P.S.  Dad and I were making breakfast the other day and I was wondering out loud "I wonder if Jerry still likes his eggs "properly neglected?"

He used the schools that he attended at the time (in parenthesis) to try to pinpoint the approx times he was at a particular house.  <br/>Cloquet (thru Sept. 1918)  <br/>Superior (1918 - ?)  <br/>Milwaukee:  <br/>1. rented house on 6th near Oklahoma Avenue - ~1923-1925 (the kids went to Oklahoma Avenue School, where John/Dad went to kindergarten and 1st grade )  <br/>2. owned a home on S 29th Street for four or five years ~1925-1929, that was lost when the depression hit in 1929 and grandpa's building and contracting business went under.  The Layton State Bank called in grandpas 2nd mortgages and the savings was lost. Grandpa went bankrupt.  Price cousins John {died of spinal meningitis on 29th St} Frank & Tony lived with the family because times were tough before the crash.  (Greenfield Ave school for a short time, Anne and John to St. Ignatious to finish the year and back to Greenfield Avenue School 2nd - 5th grade)(Note:  Greenfield Ave School was across the street from Burnham St park playground and the tennis courts)  <br/>3. rented 41st and Greenfield for about two years - ~1929-1931 (Dad/John went to St. Florians - 6th grade, dad believes Aunt Anne went to St. Barbara's)  <br/>4. rented 31st and Burnham for six years - ~1931-1938 (Greenfield Schl (graduated from 7th), Walker Jr H (8th-9th), South Div.(10th & 11th)  <br/>5. grandpa, John & Wally built the house on Kimberly Avenue - 1938 until ~1947 (when John/dad was home between his two stints in the CCC's)  <br/>6. owned a house in Woodruff 1947-1950  Grandpa and John built a cabin in back of the house where John, Anne & Dennis lived during the summer of 1948 (see Jacobsen pictures)  <br/>7. Plummer Lake Resort was built between 1948 and 1950 by Grandpa with help from John and Bill when they had time off from work.  <br/>I hope this is helpful in discerning who is on the front porch of whichever picture. Ha!  This all started when Dad and I were trying to figure out who is in the attached picture.  From comparing eyes, noses and ears to other pictures (and the front porch) we think this is Aunt Marian and Uncle Joe, in Superior (with a candlestick).

(Getting the whole Koch family together to celebrate my Mom and Dad's 50th wedding anniversary was extra special.)  2009 also brought the H1N1flu which we have avoided thus far, but we have gotten every other bug around including an eye infection Aubrin gave herself by licking her hands to wipe her eyes!<br/>Glen has hung onto his CUNA job for his 22nd year while I am enjoying a much better group of students for my 20th year of teaching.  Glen continues to enjoy sporting events while I enjoy choir.  This year I was excited to be part of the Messiah Chorus with the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra.<br/>McKenna (6) and Aubrin (4) get along very well most of the time and play elaborate games of house and school.  Both girls enjoy gymnastics which includes a bit of tap and ballet.  McKenna started last January and Aubrin in June.  They enjoyed their first taxi ride in Chicago during spring break.  We went to see the Shedd Aquarium, but their highlight was the train ride from Elgin to Chicago.<br/>McKenna is now in 1st grade and her reading has taken off.  She made a New Years "rezalation" last January to make new friends.  She is a kind-hearted soul who has trouble understanding the bad in the world.  Recently she held an "art show/sale" for the neighborhood and donated the money to charity.   Right now she wants to be an artist or geologist.  She gave us a half hour show to tell about rocks and dirt she dug up in our yard.<br/>She has lost her two bottom teeth, but never had much of a gap because the two new ones were in before the old ones finally fell out.  She tried soccer this summer, but didn't like the idea that you have to be "mean" and try to take the ball away from someone.  (Aubrin tried it too and didn't seem to mind!)  McKenna started piano lessons in June and enjoys it as long as I don't try to help!<br/>McKenna still comes up with some interesting statements.  In response to hearing us talk about money she said, "I have so much money.  If I give you all my money you will be rich.  Then you can buy us more things."  After singing "Morning Has Broken" she exclaimed, "It's hard to hold a tune for that", but stated a different time, "Sometimes when I hear myself sing I think,  - Gosh, that is so pretty'"!  <br/>I jokingly asked her if she was ever going to run out of love for her stuffed animals.  She responded, "I have so much love  -  that's why my tummy is getting so big."  Glen asked her if she was tired and she answered, "just an inch".  This summer she was helping him pick up sticks, but then seemed to just be wandering so he asked her what she was doing.  "Dad, sometimes children just need to wander around and explore the world."<br/>Aubrin loves being the only girl at daycare most days.  We are still blessed to have Sonja come to our house.  A few other kids come too which gives Aubrin a chance to learn social skills.  She loves to "run the show" and continues to learn to do so in a less bossy way.  They all enjoyed their first city bus ride downtown for a visit to Camp Randall and met Coach Bielema.  Aubrin also started her first swim lessons last January.<br/>Aubrin remains in the 5th percentile for height which adds to the cuteness of some of her statements.  When she was quite sick last January it was the first time she remembered being sick so she amazed herself when she waved goodbye to me saying, "Oh, my hand still works".<br/>She tried coming up with a new rule for a ball game we were playing and said, "Throw it to whoever you care about".  Well, she wouldn't be throwing it to us anytime soon because for Thanksgiving I asked her what she was thankful for.  You have to give her credit for listing people instead of things, but Mom and Dad were numbers 12 & 13 down the list!  And she claims she runs out of kisses so "the little man in my tummy has to fill in more kisses".<br/>She finds clever ways of expressing things she does/doesn't want to do.  "I'm trying to get up, but my bottom is too tired."  She had a fever on Halloween and tried to tell me, "trick-or-treating makes me healthier".  (Her kind sister collected enough for the both of them so that we still have two buckets on the counter!)<br/>Recently she came to me in tears saying, "My doll is growing out of her clothes".

Last summer my dinner group friends visited our house and said what a sweet house this was.   Jerry and I agree and the name stuck.  We have a comfortable life here and enjoy it very much. Jerry still works three days a week at the University Chemistry department.  He plays trumpet with a couple of groups.  I am his groupie (at least I go the concerts).<br/>I keep busy with granddaughters.  Glen and Sarah and their girls McKenna (age 3) and Aubrin (age 1) live close and I am invited over to play with them at least once a week.  Sarah teaches middle school in Monona and Glen works with computers at CUNA.<br/>Greg's family lives in Edina (Minneapolis).  Katharine is in second grade in a public school.  She is in a French program for her second year.(They speak only French in the classroom.)  We see them a few times a year. Greg still works for Carlson Hospitality.<br/>Tim still teaches and coaches at Dodgeville High School. In the summer he and his mate Sonja, her daughters and various hired help run a business providing sag services to bikers on multi day bike trips in the midwest. They pick up riders' suitcases at their hotels each morning and truck them to the riders'next hotels for the end of the day. <br/>Jerry has one granddaughter Jemma who lives in northern Indiana.  We make trips down to visit them, but the distance makes it harder than my 10 minute jaunt. Son Jeremy and his wife  Sheila stopped  with  Jemma a few times to visit when they made a swing through Wisconsin.<br/>We are fans of UW women's volleyball and sit with a fun group of friends.  UW has a good team, but they not a great one. They usually make it to the second round of the tournament. Athletics for females are sure different that when I was in school. Several of the players are over 6 feet tall.  When did girls start growing so tall?  It is great that there are things for athletic girls to do.  <br/>Jer and I attend a local Methodist Church. (Bethany).  We appreciate a discussion class  on current topics. It is  lead by very astute lay members and the conversation is always good.  <br/>My asthma is pretty much under control with medication.  Keeping the house free of dust is necessary Hardwood floors and a limited amount of upholstered  furniture help a lot. <br/>The big news of the year is that I recently got a pacemaker.   I was having passing out ceremonies and Jer was calling 911. We had planned a road trip to Wyoming, but I kept passing out.  I thought there needed to be a better solution, and it has been really great. <br/>Not much other news here.  Hope to hear from you this holiday season.

Our two biggest blessings are our daughters.  As they grow those cute quotes happen less often, but we still smile everyday.  <br/>  McKenna turned 7 in May and announced, "I don't have to act young anymore!"  Her reading and writing are noticeably improved in 2nd grade.  She enjoys piano, swimming lessons, gymnastics and dance lessons.  Her surprise for my 45th birthday was riding her bike without training wheels.  She and Glen practiced every time I was gone for about a month.  She was also brave and enjoyed her first horseback ride during a camping trip with Glen.  <br/>  Aubrin entered Kindergarten this fall and everyday she comes home with a different color of marker on her hands!  She enjoys it even though she announced after one week, "I wish we didn't sign me up".  She still loves "reading" picture books and is starting to realize that she can actually really read some of the words.  She also enjoys swim, gymnastics and dance lessons.  <br/>  Aubrin continues to observe the beauty around us stating, "Walking on snow sounds like ducks quacking."  She warmed my heart saying, "I love you mom," but then added, "--to Camp Lakotah and back" which is about 100 miles away.  <br/>  Her 5 year old brain struggles with life's mysteries.  While both girls ran in a circle chasing each other she asked, "McKenna, are you in front or back of me?"  And another important question was asked as she settled into bed.  "Mom, does Jesus have food all over Him?"  Why?  "Because He is inside us - in our heart."  <br/>  Both girls really enjoyed being flower girls in their cousin Adam's June wedding in Chicago and then returning in December for his ordination in the Lutheran church.  <br/>  The girls mostly enjoy their after school club (daycare), but definitely miss Sonja who provided priceless TLC for 6 years.  <br/>  Glen continues to enjoy UW football and basketball games.  He can't wait to watch the Badgers in the Rose Bowl soon.  He is in his 24th year at CUNA Mutual and throws away our life savings playing sheepshead with his friends - one dime at a time!  <br/>  I continue to sing in the WCC and just finished my 2nd season of singing in the Messiah chorus.  I enjoyed our family get together this summer for a surprise 80th birthday celebration for my dad.  <br/>  As you can see in the picture, we just got a 6 month old cat of which the girls are gradually becoming less afraid.  It tears around the house like a kitten, but snuggles like an old cat.  <br/>  May your 2011 have the energy of a kitten and peace of an old cat.  <br/>  Love,  <br/>  The Allisons  <br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-734042384.html">Album :story: </a>734042384["Mayme Yetka"]  Born 1895/1898 .

She had been declining somewhat and I think Jeremy and I suspected we wouldn't see her again.  We had a wonderful visit; knowing she wouldn't be able to see me doing so, I sketched her while we talked.  Grandma was always very expressive and her face simply became more so as she aged.  I can't help but think that her lively, energetic way of talking and laughing was what Grandpa fell in love with so many years ago.  I can hear her voice now in my mind as I type this.<br/>In the last few years I tried to make it a habit to call Grandma.  I knew I should try to talk to her whenever I had the chance, and every time I did so I felt that that could be the last time (actually, that is true with any conversation).  Still, sometimes when we talked I felt that she had so much spirit that physical (or even mental) frailty would only hold her back a bit, perhaps even only temporarily.  I also knew how much she cherished getting phone calls from friends and family - though usually, she would be the one to end the call, often after only a few minutes.  But I knew how important an occasional call was to her.  An reminder in my calendar program repeats every two weeks: &quot;Call Grandma.&quot;  I usually didn't, but sometimes I did... maybe it was enough.  The reminder is still there.<br/>Grandma's recent strokes left her unable to continue living independently, and it will be no surprise to those who knew her (or are descended from her) to hear how difficult this was for her.  The last time I talked to her I was in Madison for work at Dad's house when she called.  She sounded deflated and exhausted.  She asked if I would come visit her again.  I said I would.  &quot;I mean, soon,&quot; she said, and I could hear the overtones in her voice... what that meant.  I said I would.<br/>Despite a very hectic schedule, last Wednesday I was able to drive through lovely southwest Wisconsin to Lancaster.  I have always loved that part of the state, and Dad affirmed that it was a beautiful drive.  He drew excellent directions on a map.  The drive was lovely and traffic so light by Chicago standards that I often seemed to be the only car on the road.  I called Dad on my cell to get the lunch particulars correct: Subway sandwich on toasted whole wheat roll, salami, vegetables, no tomatoes; I was told they had ice cream at the Center but I went to A&W and got some anyways.<br/>Contrary to my irrational fear of nursing homes, the center was not a simulacrum of hell; it was only marginally hospital-like, and the nursing assistants were friendly and professional.  In moments I was in Grandma's room in the &quot;eighth ward.&quot;<br/>Grandma had aged substantially and had lost weight so I almost didn't recognize her sitting in her wheelchair next to her bed.  She looked like she'd been sitting there a long time.  After shuffling around a bit we got situated in a small dining area. I got a couple of sodas from the machine down the hall and found a fridge to keep the ice cream cold.<br/>I had steeled myself for a long series of complaints.  But there weren't many of these.  Instead, Grandma gushed about her lunch, how she could actually start to taste things again after her stroke.  There was one story about her roommate losing her teeth.... &quot;I still have all my teeth,&quot; she said, showing me the bottom row, which were straighter than mine.<br/>I told her what was going on with me, about work, art, Eden, the Chicago Marathon.<br/>&quot;What sort of sports did you do when you were young, Grandma?  You used to bowl, right?&quot; (I remembered the bowling and golf trophies on Dad's shrine shelf.)<br/>She described regular bowling nights.  &quot;I was ok at it.  Not great.  But your uncle [I think she meant Grandpa] was always so critical.  'You don't know how to do it!  Do it this way!  Do it that way!'  One time I got so mad I just walked up to the lane and didn't even look, I just threw the ball down.  Strike!  I was so mad.  I didn't even look.  I just picked up another ball and bowled it.  Strike!  I didn't even look.  You know how many strikes I got?  Five in a row!  Everyone in the bowling alley came over and watched.  I got the highest score for the year.  Normally I had a kind of average score, but that one was just off the charts.&quot;<br/>&quot;So Grandpa could be critical, huh?&quot;<br/>&quot;Oh yes.  That's just how men are, you know.  So competitive with each other, and with us.&quot;<br/>&quot;What were some of the really nice times you had together?&quot;  I asked, wanting to keep us both focused on the positive.<br/>&quot;Oh, when we travelled... probably when we went gleaning.&quot;<br/>I strained to hear what she said.  &quot;Gleaning?&quot;<br/>&quot;We had these really nice friends.  Frieda was her name -- she was such a good friend.  Her husband was Lloyd.  Grandpa and I travelled with them; taking two trucks, driving to Mexico.<br/>&quot;Frieda and I just completely hit it off.  Lloyd was an ok guy, but Frieda was such a good friend.  We were such good friends until she was taken away too early, at 53.  Anyways, we'd travel south, and there would be fields along the way.  Great big fields full of crops - corn, potatoes, all sorts of stuff.  And there would be stuff falling off the plants, all over the ground.<br/>&quot;Wherever there were people picking the crops, we'd stop.  We never, ever stole anything - I saw people go on other people's land, and take some corn - that's stealing.  But when we saw people harvesting, I'd say, 'Stop!'  And we'd stop, and I'd get out and walk up to the people.  'Who's in charge here?'  I'd ask.  Someone would point and I'd walk up to him.<br/>&quot;'What do you want?' he'd say.<br/>&quot;'What are you going to do with all this food on the ground!?'<br/>&quot;'You want it?  Take it!'&quot;<br/>&quot;So we'd get out and pick it up; bushels of it, and we'd bring it back to the trailer park, and we'd just feed everyone there!  Everyone was just amazed!  Oh, we had such a good time.&quot;<br/>(I thought about what it meant to grow up during the Great Depression -- though a little sleuthing on the 'Net, or in the Bible, for that matter, will turn up references to the practice of gleaning.)<br/>&quot;What happened to Frieda?&quot;<br/>She described Frieda's last day with them, swimming in Mexico, the aneurism.  The authorities accusing them of carrying scarlet fever and forcing them to leave Mexico, driving across the border in the two trucks.  Her death the next day at age 53.<br/>&quot;She was such a good friend, she died too young, and it wasn't the same when Lloyd found someone else.  But Frieda and I had such a good time.  Sometimes there were oysters -- we did the same thing.  We'd go up to these guys, and they'd give us oysters.  We were only in our 50s, so we were pretty nice looking girls [!].  You know, really fresh oysters are really good.  We had such fun.<br/>&quot;You and I had so much fun too, on our trip [the one to California, when I was eight].&quot;  We talked about that a bit, what we remembered, who we visited (I needed a refresher on names and relations).  She remembered taking me to Circus Circus in Las Vegas, how they let me in despite my tender age, the Blue Moon ice cream cone the size of my head.  I remembered her waking me up in the middle of the night in San Diego to see the Lunar Eclipse and the snails on the ground.<br/>At some point one of the nurses came in and said hello.  She was just lovely with Grandma.<br/>&quot;This is my wonderful grandson John, who came to visit me...&quot;<br/>&quot;Did you come from Madison?&quot;<br/>&quot;Chicago, actually, but I drove from Madison today,&quot; I replied.<br/>&quot;What do you do in Chicago?&quot;<br/>&quot;I'm a computer consultant there.&quot;<br/>Grandma astonished me by chiming in.  &quot;John travels to really cold places, like the South Pole, and works on physics experiments.  They drill holes deep in the ice and put fancy equipment down in the holes to see stuff from the stars.&quot;  I have a hard time explaining it better myself.<br/>We talked some more.  She described her morning therapy, her work with the doctor.<br/>&quot;I can walk much better now,&quot; she said.  &quot;I walked all the way around the room today.  All I need is for someone to bring me some masking tape for this hand&quot; (pointing to her left hand) &quot;to tape my hand to the walker, and I can walk around.&quot;<br/>&quot;How's your grip?&quot;  She held out her right hand - her hand was cool and dry, the grip firm and steady.  &quot;How about the other hand?&quot;  The grip was there too, though weaker.<br/>&quot;Wow, you've got a good grip there.  Keep it up and I'll bet you'll be able to walk around pretty well.&quot;<br/>&quot;Oh, I'm trying, every day I try.&quot;  She talked about how the doctor told her she had to eat more.  I continued trying to get her to eat more of her sandwich, or take some more bites of ice cream.  &quot;No thank you, I'm pretty full.  Did you finish yours?  Are you still hungry?  Do you want the rest of mine?&quot;  I wrapped up her sandwich to give to the staff to give her for dinner.  &quot;I'm going to keep getting better so I can go back to my apartment.&quot;<br/>As usual, Grandma ended the visit before I had a chance.  We started to wrap things up.  I told her firmly I would see her again, and we said our goodbyes.  I walked down the hall with tears in my eyes.  I passed the Nurse's Station and said thanks to the nurse on duty.  She looked at me compassionately and said, &quot;be happy.&quot;<br/>Perhaps I knew that I was wrong - that it would be the last time, after all.  Or perhaps it was just the silence of it, of leaving her there where I found her, parked next to her bed, with the call button for the nurses on her lap.  But it got to me.  After getting in the car and bawling for a little while, I did some exploring on the way home.  I found some lovely spots (turning left at a sign saying &quot;Rustic Road - next 372 miles,&quot; I found a simple but gorgeous and stately chapel on a hill next to an old cemetery).  I looked these up with Dad on Google Earth, to see on my next visit.<br/>But there will be no next time.  Grandma died this morning.  Born before the First World War, she failed to outlive the Second Gulf War (though hopefully not by much).  She saw the Great Depression, the dawn of equal suffrage for American women, World War Two, the Red Scare, &quot;Duck and Cover,&quot; the Cuban Missile Crisis, 25 years of American military involvement in Vietnam, the first moon walks, the Civil Rights movement, sixteen US presidents; beatniks, hippies, yuppies, yippies; the rise and fall of Communism; the Golden Age of Radio, the invention of the electronic digital computer, of TV, gene-sequencing, nuclear power, the Internet.<br/>She gave the world three wonderful, smart, stubborn children, twelve grandchildren, lord knows how many current and future great-grandchildren.<br/>She gave us her love, her lectures, her laughter.<br/>I will not forget.<br/>John Jacobsen<br/>Chicago, IL<br/>11-4-2006<br/>Fine print: The details and conversations above are recounted from memory; any errors or omissions are my responsibility.<br/>John Jacobsen<br/>NPX Designs, Inc.<br/>Contact info: http://www.npxdesigns.com/contact.html<br/><br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-753860997.html">Album :story: </a>753860997["George Popelka"] 2009-01-24 Obituary<br/>George William Popelka passed away on Thursday January 15, 2009 at Vernon Manor in Viroqua Wisconsin at the age of 93. George was comforted with the presence of his children at the time of his passing. George was born July 30, 1915 in Breed Wisconsin (Oconto County) in a one room log cabin to Anton M and Mary T (Kugel) Popelka. He was the middle child of 15 children and was known as &quot;the quiet one&quot;. He was raised near Mountain Wisconsin and attended Kingston Grade School and Union Free High School in Mountain. During World War II, he worked at Badger Ordinance Munitions plant in Baraboo, where he met Doris Louis. George and Doris were married on August 10, 1949 in Menominee MI.

The exceptions are to do a few jobs around the house, to eat meals, or weekly, to visit some of his family.  He likes to watch TV.  His family is generous to him.  Ted Scheidegger mows his lawn, Shirley takes him to church (and Theresa to the store). He is frustrated to tears that no one wants him to drive any more, especially after the accident. A month or so ago (summer 1998) he put the car into reverse, almost slammed two houses, sped backwards for a half a block, took a chunk out of a tree and almost hit a third house.  The car was two thirds its original size.  He blocked out any memory of what happened.  He emerged with a few scratches and a terribly damaged ego.<br/>   He retired at about 50 from the fire department.  For the next decade or so, they traveled alot with their small airstream trailer, mostly to Texas or Mexico. <br/>   During his fire department years, he typically had 24 hour shifts.

They lost everything.  Her dad had just built the house.  There were six kids at the time. Her mother's father (Albert Sojka) died in his house trying to save stuff.  The family was carried out of town in box cars.  She vividly remembers her father (John Yetka) being restrained from jumping out of the box car trying to go back.  Her mother quotes the four year old smart mouth as saying the Kaiser spread his tail and started the fire.  <br/>From there they went to Eloise WI a suburb of Superior.  John built another house in Superior near the ore docks (from which another fire worried them but caused no harm).  Theresa's happy memories include running up the stairs to sit in a window box looking out at her mom working in the garden, or watching all of Superior coming by to see the long rows of sweet peas.<br/>When Theresa was 8 the family moved to Milwaukee because Aunt Elizabeth and Uncle Joe Soike were there and told them that work was available.  (Les and Tes both admired the guts they had, moving a large family like that).  They first lived on South 13th street.  She remembers enjoying helping the grocer across the street at about age 10.  They then bought a flat on 8th street, and about 1937 (Les and Tes marriage) built the house on Kimberly (which was far enough out to have farm animals and gardens).

I had gotten a list of relatives and friends from their address book on one of my visits there and unbeknownst to them, I sent out a letter requesting people to send a card for a surprise   a card party  and asking if they had any photos or memories from the past that they would enclose them with their cards.  They got a huge response and made their anniversary very special.  <br/>Among the many responses, they got a packet from Durell Belanger who lives in Newberg, Oregon.  He had photocopied some old pictures that he had and enclosed a portion of a book he had written for his descendents of his memories of growing up in the Mountain area.  These are a snapshot of a photocopy.  I snapped a photo (5.3MP) of the page and a closer photo of each picture.  It would be nice to get a digital copy of the originals.  <br/>Durell was born September 11, 1916.  He was a year younger than my Dad.  Emery and Minnie Belanger were his parents.  He spent a lot of time with the Popelka kids.  When I sent an e-mail out to let relatives and friends know that Dad had passed, he wrote back to me  aThank you Betty.  It is a blessing that George did not suffer for a long time. George has suffered a lot in his early years when the horse he was riding fell and broke his leg.

He used the schools that he attended at the time (in parenthesis) to try to pinpoint the approx times he was at a particular house.  <br/>Cloquet (thru Sept. 1918)  <br/>Superior (1918 - ?)  <br/>Milwaukee:  <br/>1. rented house on 6th near Oklahoma Avenue - ~1923-1925 (the kids went to Oklahoma Avenue School, where John/Dad went to kindergarten and 1st grade )  <br/>2. owned a home on S 29th Street for four or five years ~1925-1929, that was lost when the depression hit in 1929 and grandpa's building and contracting business went under.  The Layton State Bank called in grandpas 2nd mortgages and the savings was lost. Grandpa went bankrupt.  Price cousins John {died of spinal meningitis on 29th St} Frank & Tony lived with the family because times were tough before the crash.  (Greenfield Ave school for a short time, Anne and John to St. Ignatious to finish the year and back to Greenfield Avenue School 2nd - 5th grade)(Note:  Greenfield Ave School was across the street from Burnham St park playground and the tennis courts)  <br/>3. rented 41st and Greenfield for about two years - ~1929-1931 (Dad/John went to St. Florians - 6th grade, dad believes Aunt Anne went to St. Barbara's)  <br/>4. rented 31st and Burnham for six years - ~1931-1938 (Greenfield Schl (graduated from 7th), Walker Jr H (8th-9th), South Div.(10th & 11th)  <br/>5. grandpa, John & Wally built the house on Kimberly Avenue - 1938 until ~1947 (when John/dad was home between his two stints in the CCC's)  <br/>6. owned a house in Woodruff 1947-1950  Grandpa and John built a cabin in back of the house where John, Anne & Dennis lived during the summer of 1948 (see Jacobsen pictures)  <br/>7. Plummer Lake Resort was built between 1948 and 1950 by Grandpa with help from John and Bill when they had time off from work.  <br/>I hope this is helpful in discerning who is on the front porch of whichever picture. Ha!  This all started when Dad and I were trying to figure out who is in the attached picture.  From comparing eyes, noses and ears to other pictures (and the front porch) we think this is Aunt Marian and Uncle Joe, in Superior (with a candlestick).

In the fall I developed asthma from a dust mite infestation at my condo. It took quite a while to find the source of the trouble.  Finally took a piece of carpet to the State Hygiene Lab and they identified the culprit.  I left my condo and stayed with Glen and Sarah for a while, then at a friend's house (there lot of was dust there too).  Finally, some people from church invited me to stay at their home while they traveled. <br/>A doctor local doctor prescribed steroids and they did help. However, I did not want to be on steroids indefinitely (though he said I could take them the rest of my life without harm!!)  A contact at the state Lab of Hygiene told me about a good allergy doctor who did lots of skin tests and identified the culprit.<br/>My sons tore out the mite infested carpet and pad.  While living elsewhere, I went back to my condo every day, and wearing a respirator, scrubbed the all the subfloors with bleach water and then painted them with KILZ.  I washed all the bedding and scrubbed every surface in the condo and moved boxes from the basement to the garage. Finally, I could move back in. The final chore was to rid the basement stuff of dust mite poop.  I washed boxes of fabric, cleaned all the tools and threw out lots of stuff that couldn't be cleaned.  <br/>Then the year got better.  I have been dating a sweet old guy, Jerry Jacobsen, for a couple of years and this summer we sold both or our places and in July we bought a house together. We met dancing and both like gardening and biking and house projects.  He also has three sons. He works 60% time for the UW Chemistry department producing instructional materials.  (Lots of computer and camera work.)  He is unfailingly patient, kind and helpful.<br/>In August, 2004 we took a road trip to the Seattle to visit his brother and his mate who live on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound. Also, in 2004, we hosted a party at Jer's house to celebrate his mom's 90th birthday.  I feel very fortunate to have a good friend to share my life. There was so much moving this summer that we didn't do much for fun. We will plan a trip for next summer. <br/>Glen and Sarah had a second daughter at the end of June.  Her name is Aubrin. I am a regular visitor at their house, especially when Sarah goes to choir practice and Glen is left with both of them. I love to play with 2 year old McKenna.

At the time of his birth in Brevik, Norway it was the custom for a son to take the given name of his father "Jacob" to which was added "son" thus the Jacobsen.  This custom caused a chaotic situation and in 1901 a law was passed which stabilized the family names as they were at that time.  So, except for the twist of fate and a few years, this could have been the Family Tree of the "Kjendalen's" - or Americanized "Schondelen's" instead of the Jacobsen's.  <br/>  Family of Jacob and Andria Kjendalen:  <br/>  <ol>  <li>Jacob Jacobsen  <li>Inga Jacobsen married Louis Christopherson (6 Girls and 6 Boys)  <li>Louis and Molly Jacobsen - carpenter (8 children)  <li>Hans and Mary Jacobsen (2 girls and 2 boys)  <li>Martin Jacobsen  <li>Pete Jacobsen  <li>Andrew Jacobsen  </ol>  Kjearsti Seversen was the daughter of Ingeborg O.

JJJ]. Mother with her parents [Sever O. Jorsta and Ingeborg O. Jorsta], sister and two brothers from Valders, Norway. Dad with his parents [Jacob Kjendalen and Andria Kjendalen], five brothers and a sister from Brevik, Norway. All ocean travel (I've been told) was by sailboat at that time and usually took two to three months. The passengers had to bring their own food, a big part of it being "Flatbro" something like hardtack. The "lefse" that they very likely all had along didn't keep that long.  Many of these immigrants from Norway came to Valders, Wis (near Manitowoc), which we understand was named after Valders, Norway.  <br/>  My father had told Emma that his uncle in Norway had asked him to stay.  He was a doctor and wanted dad to be educated in his profession.  Grandma Andria cried over the suggestion they be separated, so his uncle said he could always come back. Dad and his folks were on the ocean for seven weeks.  <br/>  Don't know how long dad's family had been living on a little farm when Grandpa Jake [Jacob Kjendalen] was killed by lightening while hewing timbers for the Lutheran Church in Ashwabenon -- horses and wagon also destroyed. Dad [Jacob Jacobsen], being the oldest son [in the home at that time], was the man of the house. Dad's confirmation class '72 was the first use of the new Norwegian Church of Ft. Howard.  He had to walk several miles to a neighbor to borrow horses and wagon to take his mother, sister, and five brothers to the confirmation rites. They had spent the preceeding Saturday cleaning up, including the plaster on windows and floor. The pews consisted of planks on overturned empty nail kegs.   <br/>  Before long the family was moved to a little house at Woodlawn Cemetery w[h]ere the younger boys also helped.  In time, dad's brother Hans (who was supposed to be able to make a match stick grow) was selected to mark-out and develop Ft. Howard Cemetery where people of all faiths could be buried.  <br/>  Mother and Dad were married August 22, 1877 in Ft. Howard.  In 1885 our parents with daughters Emma, Jennie, Christine, and son Carl moved to an eighty acre falm in Glenmore, Wis. purchased while dad was still employed by Woodlawn Cemetery.  Much of the land had to be cleared of trees and brush.  Dad had a grocery store and cheese factory on the property. Some of the lower land was tilled and we had the first silo in Brown county.The farm was expanded to 120 acres.  <br/>  In Glenmore the Norwegian settlers were building the Zion Lutheran Church, all work donated except the chairman, Ole Rogne, carpenter aged 25 who was paid $1.00 per day. (This man was Henrik Peterson's uncle. [Henrik or Hank Peterson was Clara's husband. I have no further information about Hank's ancestors or family. JJJ]) After the church was built, they didn't know how they were going to hoist the bell up into the tower. Father came with a crane or a similar piece of equipment from the cemetery and the bell was raised into the belfrey without trouble. Our mother's father Sever Jostra had been a cabinet maker in Norway before coming to this country, and he made a beautiful alter while his son, Ole, a carpenter made the pulpits.  <br/>  Our father was Treasurer for the Town of Gilmore in 1894. To show how times have changed, uncle Knut Severson paid taxes of $5.25 on 40 acres of land (receipt still in scrap book).  The night before all this loose money was to be turned in to headquarters at the Green Bay County Seat, my father asked Uncle Ole Severson, and two neighbors ... to come spend the night and help guard the money. They played cards 'til morning. (We had robbers in those days too. The Brennon brothers living in another township were notorious.) I never saw my fathers's revolver, but was told he came out of the bedroom with the weapon one night after hearing strange noises, abd was very much relieved when he heard a rocker going back and forth on the hardwood floor.  My sister Jennie had again been sleep-walking.  <br/>  We had a Depression during the Cleveland Administration [Panic of 1893] and he lost the farm.  <br/>  Then we moved to DePere w[h]ere dad [Jacob Jacobsen] entered the ice business with sons Carl and Sigurd helping.  They had to harvest the ice out of the river in winter and store it covered with thick layers of sawdust.  In the summer two wagons delivered the ice around town.   <br/>  When our parents move to a farm near Otis, Lincoln County (near Merrill) [between Wausau and Tomahawk] Carl worked at the Lyons Boiler Works in DePere and Sigurd moved to Milwaukee.   <br/>  In time Sigurd ... had his own electrical contracting company which was passed on to his son Roy when he retired. Carl later founded Wisconsin Fabricating Company (Structural Steel) of Green Bay.  [ from their web site:  Wisconsin Fabricating Company has been providing machine shops, building contractors, and small businesses with quality custom fabricating and supplies since 1926.] Christine and her husband Fred Bergelin moved to Los Angeles in 1904. Emma soon followed and met and married Carlos Arriola, a flutist in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. After serving as a musician in World War I, Carlos became a member of the Hollywood Orchestra playing the prologues and epiloguse at the famous Egyptian and Hollywood Chinese Theatres (both Grauman's). They made their home in Culver City, Ca.  <br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415516.html">Album :story: </a>1071415516["Jacob Jacobsen" "Kjaersti Jacobsen"] 2011-11-19 Part 4 of 5 - Letter from aunt Shirley (Jacobsen Johnsen).  <br/>  In 1917 Mother and Dad sold their Lincoln County farm and moved to Los Angeles Cal. soon to be followed by Lena, Clara a visitor for a couple years prior to her marriage, and later Louise and her Husband Henry Reese. At that time the folks lived on Second Street in Hollywood close to all the major studios w[h]ere it was possible to walk from one studio to another if interested. That building has been replaced by buildings now housing motion picture and television industry.  <br/>  From there they purchased property on Sepulveda Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley and built a nice two bedroom home a few miles from the Reese family in Zelzah (now called Northridge). When Emma and Carlos settled in Culver City, the folks sold their San Fernando Valley home and purchased property close to them on Cataragus Street [now Cattaraugus Avenue]. After Carlos' death they moved in with Emma who was very good and loving to them in their aging years. Culver City, then a sparsely settled community named the street between the residence on Helms Ave and Washington Blvd (a main thoroughfare between L.A. and the Beach Cities) Jacob Street.   [This convoluted sentence says that they named a street in LA after Jacob Jacobsen.  Google maps shows that the street so named still exists.  JJJ  2011 ]    <br/>  Early in the summer of 1927, my parents came from California to spend the summer with us on the farm. We had planned on painting the house that year and it wa[s]n't long before dad started putting up scaffolding to stand on while painting. Even mother got into the act. Often there were three painting at the same time. A cousin from Chicago and husband came to visit about this time (Celia and Adolph Effinger) and Adolph who had done much painting offered to do the upper part of the house. Naturally we were happy about that.  I remember doing the window trims, even on the second floor.  <br/>  This was the year of the folks Golden Wedding Anniversary. Since there were relatives and friends to come from Milwaukee and Chicago, we decided to have the celebration on the Sunday before Labor Day. I made mother's dress of a soft grey silk and put on a lace collar. However my good friend Evelyn Laing came for the celebration and she brought out an heirloom lace collar made by her mother in Ireland.  <br/>  We took up the carpet in the large living room and put in tables diagonally. Had to borrow dishes from neighbors and also from a grocery store... There were no paper tablecloths then, so we also had to borrow some [tablecloths]. We had the wedding ceremony at the church ... sang Mother's favorite Silver Threads among the Gold.  <br/>  [...details about the meal...] Julia, Carl's wife, helped ...  In the evening the tables were cleared away in the living room, the floor well waxed and we had a three piece orchestra (neighbors) for dancing. The Bride and Groom were the only ones on the floor to start out but soon the floor was full. Before the guest went home, a small lunch was served.  <br/>  They lived to celebrate their 61st Wedding Anniversary together.  <br/>  Our mother's parents, Sever and Ingeborg Jostra, came from Valders Valley, Norway. My mother had one sister, Sarah, who married Knut Helgeson. She died in 1891. There were also brothers Ole and Knut whose last names were Severson ... Unless some of her Norwegian friends were talking to Mother, she was addressed as "Guste".  <br/>  Our father's parents, Jacob and Andria Kjendalen (pronounced Schondalen) meaning "beautiful valley" came from Brevik, Norway.  He had five brothers and a sister. in 1877 his sister Inga married Louis Christopherson and they farmed in Ashwaubenan and were blessed with a fine family of six boys and six girls. Brother Louis (a carpenter) and his wife Molly were blessed with eight children.  Brother Hans (with the green thumb) and his wife Mary had two boys and two girls.  Brother Martin became a sailor, while Pete and Andrew (both unmarried) continued to work at Woodlawn Cemetery until retiring.  <br/>  Dad's Mother, Andria Jacobsen had a sister Bertha Hansen. Aunt Bertha had three daughters, Hannah, Mary, and Catherine. The three girls sewed beautiful dresses for the elite of Green Bay (no ready-made dresses at that time). Mary Hansen married Peter Olson of Milwaukee and had two daughters Arleen and Beatrice, and eventually moved to Pasadena, California. Her sister Catherine "Kit" Cochrane with son Elliott also moved to  Pasadena where the sisters lived next door to each other. Kit and her son Elliott ran a dancing school and Mary continued with her beautiful sewing. Our folks often visited the cousins in their beautifully furnished homes. [... re furnishings...] Real Antiques!  <br/>  [... Andria's 6 sons as pallbearers ...]  <br/>  In the late 1920's and early 1930's (in Los Angeles at that time) our Dad attended many "Townsend Plan" Meetings, as did his son Sigurd in Milwaukee. According this Plan, older citizens would get $200.00 a month that had to be spent to aid the economy. One could buy for others, if need be. This plan we believe was the fore-runner of Social Security.  <br/>   [JJJ The following from a history of Social Security - Dr. Townsend published his plan in a Long Beach, California newspaper, as a kind of extended "Letter to the Editor," in early 1933. He was surprised by the swift and massive response the letter generated. Townsend had tapped a major social problem in America (poverty among the elderly) and the nation was crying out for a solution. Townsend's letter led to the formation of an organization and the development of a formal Plan. The Plan was then published as a pamphlet and distributed throughout America.]  <br/>  [I felt this is important because Sigurd was an activist of sorts, always writing letters to newspaper editors. His dad Jacob was active at the beginning of Social Security. Sigurd's hot button was health food. I remember him getting a subscription to Prevention magazine for mom (Tess)]<br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415517.html">Album :story: </a>1071415517["Jacob Jacobsen" "Kjaersti Jacobsen"] 2011-11-18 Part 5 of 5 - Letter from aunt Shirley (Jacobsen Johnsen).  <strong>Caliifornia Recollections:</strong>  When Gramdma and Grandpa Jacobsen [Jacob and Andria] moved to Los Angeles in 1917, we met them at the train depot-- no competitive Greyhound buses or airplanes at the time. We were immensely impressed with Grandpa's beard and bear-fur lined overcoat. The rented a small house close-by while re-locating and we got to know them very well.  <br/>  In mid-afternoon they always served coffee usually with both rye and white breads, cheeses, and a light cake or cookies with lump sugar to sweeten the coffee. But before the coffee was made, first the ritual of Grandma grinding the coffee beans holding the grinder in her lap clamped between her knees, releasing a fresh coffee aroma pleasant to we who didn't even drink coffee. (Sometimes as a special treat we were allowed to do this task for her, but it wasn't as easy as it looked.) Grandma Jacobsen [Andria] was famous for her hot gingerbread and delicious lemon pies. Grandma's hands were always busy-- knitting socks, mending, etc. and once in a great while she would reminisce. She told of younger days in Wisconsin and their friends, some travels by covered wagon, a bewitched cow they once had, and church as she was a very religious person.     <br/>  Grandpa was a great talker and loved to tease. One of my favorite stories he used to tell: "There were six boys in our family and each had a sister". the listener usually added that up to twelve children and gasped. Actually there were six boys and one sister. <br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415518.html">Album :story: </a>1071415518["Sigurd Jacobsen" "Les Jacobsen" "Marie Alma Jacobsen" "Alma Jacobsen"] 1918 During World War 1, Sig went to Maryland to work in a factory to support his new family.

After high school, Judy attended Milton College and the University of Wisconsin-Madison where she earned her bachelor's degree in business and accounting. After college, Judy worked for many years as a certified public accountant for Virchow Krause and Company auditing school districts and municipalities. Prior to retirement, Judy worked for Stoughton Utilities.<BR>Judy spent much of her adult life in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, where she was an active member of the Sun Prairie United Methodist Church. She took several high school ministry backpacking trips to the Rocky Mountains and canoeing trips in the Boundary Waters where she often served as camp cook for Wisconsin youth. She loved to help people, whether it was as part of the church, in Sun Prairie Civic Theater, or as part of Parents Without Partners. An avid enjoyer of nature, Judy particularly enjoyed silent sports. Judy enjoyed biking, hiking, and camping in many of Wisconsin's State Parks. Judy especially enjoyed visiting Door County. <BR>Later in life Judy was happy to meet Jerrold Jacobsen. They enjoyed gardening, music, biking, and traveling together. Judy especially enjoyed her time ballroom dancing with Jerry.<BR>Judy had a zest and contagious enthusiasm for living life fully. She loved people, especially talking to friends and relatives, often so long that her children would give up waiting in the car for her and walk home from church. Judy's love of children was obvious as she would beam when engaging with children or talking about her children and grandchildren. Judy did not know the meaning of the word shy and raised her three children as a single mother with a strong will, determination, and energy. That strong will, when mixed with a wooden spoon, was not always a welcome attribute to her three boys at the time, but is now a poignant memory.<BR>Judy was preceded in death by her mother Margaret (Popelka) Richardson and father Harlow Richardson.<BR>Judy is survived by her three boys Glen (Sarah) of Middleton, WI, Greg of Edina, MN, and Tym of Ridgeway, WI and her three special granddaughters Katharine, McKenna, and Aubrin.

The couple resided in Oconto, WI, for 4 years and since 1950 have lived in Sheboygan County.<br/>Mary Jane was a homemaker, worked as a nurse's aide at Rocky Knoll Health Care Facility for several years and was a rural mail carrier at the Glenbeulah Post Office for over 10 years retiring in 1991. <br/>She was a member of St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in Elkhart Lake, sang in the choir, belonged to the Christian Mothers Society, was a religious educator coordinator and catechist.

One with flash, the other without.<br/>I have been seeing her weekly and the past few times, I thought she was doing really well. She seemed to be getting around (always with her walker) and seemed to be brighter and stronger. Yesterday was not so good.<br/>When I stopped in, her place was dark so I wasn't sure if she might have been elsewhere in the building. I knocked on the door and she answered. She was laying on her bed, resting. <br/>She said she had been sick on Saturday and Sunday. Couldn't eat much. Was nauseated. The top of her head hurt. She said she was feeling some better but I noticed that she seemed winded. Even while laying down she seemed short of breath. Her apartment had the windows open but was very warm and stuffy. We propped open the door to the hall and the breeze came through and it was more comfortable after that. <br/>She got up by herself and wanted to go to the living room, which she was able to do herself with the walker. Then sat in the rocker for the rest of the visit. Probably about an hour. We looked at pictures from Aunt Jane's (Alvin's wife) service from May 11th. I had taken her last summer to Adrian's wife's service in Appleton but she was not doing well enough to go to Elkhart Lake, although wished she could have been there to visit. A few weeks ago, I had taken her to get her glasses adjusted, just down the street a few blocks. It was quite an effort for her just to do that and I knew anything more than that would be too much for her. She tires easily now.<br/>She seemed short of breath for my whole visit. Even just sitting in the chair. The staff is watching her closely. Her foster daughter, Sandy, was supposed to be there sometime today. <br/>My plan for this visit was to attach the photos to an e-mail from her so she could send you a message but the internet at her complex was not working. She thought that would be a neat thing to do. I took her picture near the end of my visit. She perked up at the thought of getting her picture taken. She sat up and fussed about her lipstick and hair. I thought they were very good pictures of her. It is sometimes hard to think of her as a 92 year old.<br/>She said Deborah is coming up on Sunday, 26th, for the day. She didn't come for Mother's day because of a city wide rummage sale that they participated in. She told Shirley that she would be up this past weekend but had to plant their garden. Yesterday, Shirley said that Deborah is coming on Sunday, 26th, for the day. <br/>She is asking about Kevin and, I think, Brian. She had phone #s for each of them but when she tried them, they did not go through. <br/>As I read through this, it is kind of a downer e-mail. Just wanted to keep you updated, though.<br/>I will send the pictures from Aunt Jane's service in a separate e-mail.<br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415525.html">Album :story: </a>1071415525["Jeff Jacobsen"] 2013-05-06 Jeff goes for a swim in Puget Sound with his friends.<br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415526.html">Album :story: </a>1071415526["Jemma Jacobsen"] 2013-05-20 Jemma's exhibit for the art museum at navy pier<BR/>Mainly, the exhibit is about kids and stuffed animals.<BR/>Interview<BR/>Young artist's work on display at Chicago Children's Museum<BR/>New exhibit, Ready, Pet, Go, opens May 22<BR/>By Elizabeth Diffin<BR/>Monday, May 20, 2013<BR>It's not every day that your artwork gets displayed in a museum, especially when you're eight years old. But that's not the case for Jemma Jacobsen of Hammond, Ind., who helped the Chicago Children's Museum decorate their new exhibit, Ready, Pet, Go!, opening Wednesday. We talked to the second grader about her role and what she thinks about it.<BR>How did you end up doing the artwork for this exhibit?<BR>My mom's friend Jenny who works at the Children's Museum knows how well I draw, so she asked me to do some of the drawings.<BR>Do you have any pets?<BR>I have two cats, a fish and a bunny.<BR>If you could have any pet in the world, what would it be?<BR>That's kind of a hard one. But me and my friend Char both thought we would really, really, really, really like a horse.<BR>What kind of animals did you draw for the museum?<BR>Horses and hamsters and cats and dogs and snakes.<BR>Do you have a favorite one?<BR>There's a guinea pig that I think was really cute.<BR>Is there any animal that's really hard to draw?<BR>For some reason, I find it really hard to draw a dolphin.<BR>What's your favorite kind of art?<BR>I like drawing. And most of my drawings at home are of my cats.<BR>Do your friends know that you're going to have artwork in a museum?<BR>Most of my friends at school don't believe me, but I say “You'll see that I really am.” I showed them the plans for it and they finally believed it. Most of my friends didn't think that I was going to have an interview today!<BR>How do you feel when you think about your art being in a museum?<BR>It makes me feel really excited. And it makes me wonder if any of my friends would go to the Children's Museum and see it.<BR>What do you think it will be like to see your drawings at the museum?<BR>I don't really know, but I'm sure it's going to be really fun.<br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415527.html">Album :story: </a>1071415527["McKenna Allison" "Aubrin Allison"] 2011-12-11 McKenna and Aubrin at the Christmas Pageant at Asbury Church.<br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-1071415528.html">Album :story: </a>1071415528["Jerry Jacobsen"] 2013-04 My first Road Scholar (Elder Hostel) to New York City (Signature City).

An emotional roller coaster. I loved the stories that were told. McKenna''s tribute was particularly touching. What poise for someone her age. And the ending of the service was perfect! Jerry J., I loved the look on your face when you walked back into the sanctuary during this time. This had to be so hard for all of you. She will be missed by many but particularly by all of you. Until we meet again.<BR>It was good to meet you boys and your families. Like I said, Glen was about 18 months old when I saw him last and the rest of you were not in the picture yet.<BR>I enjoyed the extra visit with Jerry and Larry when you came to Green Bay to visit your Aunt Shirley. Larry, I am glad that you brought the tributes to Kevin''s life. You have been through a lot this year, too.<BR>Shortly after this service, I drove down to Huntsville, Alabama, to pick up our 3 granddaughters (ages 10, 6, and 4) and brought them back to Green Bay to stay for a few weeks. They are moving to a new home in the Huntsville area this summer. School starts here August 5th and they wanted to be moved in by then. Mission accomplished but still have a lot of settling to do.<BR>By our taking the girls, their Mom and Dad could do the packing up and the girls could have some fun time. That meant a road trip including a hotel stay. We enjoyed their time with us and last week, Tom and I brought them back to Huntsville for the big move. A really busy month for us.<BR>We will not get back home until sometime after the 5th of August so will not be able to get to the Pelky family reunion tomorrow.<BR>Take care and love to all.<br/>Betty<br/>3rd from left is Tym's friend.<br/>Also this information from Betty: Jeanie (Betty Jean) Helmer is standing behind me.

Very nice, but sad.<BR>I lived in Madison from 1970 to 1974. I went to St. Mary's School of Nursing on Brooks Street/Delaplaine Ct. Our first year of nursing school was at Edgewood College. We used to go through the zoo by Lake Wingra on foot or bicycle to get to school. I saw some photos, you took at roughly that time, of your boys near Lake Wingra when they were very young.

He was born on Oct. 22, 1969, in Madison, to Sandra (Wheadon) Jacobsen and Richard Rupert.  Eben had a heart of gold, an infectious smile and a kind heart. He loved his sons, Fletcher and Davis more than anything in the world and will watch over them forever. He could not have been prouder of the young men they were and are becoming. Eben was a ‘Sconnie’ through and through. He loved watching his sons excel both in school and in the sports they both played. Eben loved the outdoors while hunting, fishing or taking in a Badgers or Packers game.  It was through the tears of a clown that Eben persevered. Although all those around him felt his charismatic and intelligent energy, he never did.  Ultimately Eben turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism, which eventually became the demon too fierce for him to overcome. Those that knew him witnessed his battle to recover, but even more importantly saw his fight to love through the pain and loss that is addiction.  Our profound sense of loss is comforted by our loving memories of Eben. We know that his intrinsically loving, kind spirit is no longer tethered to a body so wracked with disease.  God speed Eben.  May you now accept and let in all the love you had around you.  The family asks that you hold Eben close to your hearts. A Celebration of Eben’s Life will be held in October, date and location to be announced.  In the meantime, knowing how adamant Eben was for his children to do well and succeed in school, a college fund has been set up in his honor for his sons’ future education. Nicolet Bank, Attn:  Jamie G., 111 N. Washington St., Green Bay, WI  54301.

John was born August 28, 1918 in Cloquet, Minnesota to John Martin Yetka and Barbara Margaret Soijke. John met the girl of his dreams on a train, while headed home on furlough, and a year later married Anna Jahner on July 31, 1945. <br/> He is survived by children, Dianne (Michael) Linskens, Corinne Yetka, and Robert (Christy) Yetka; grandchildren, Nicole, Brett (Paula), Tricia and Michaela Linskens, Samantha and Alex Yetka; great-grandchildren, Brianna, Sarina, and Carina Halvorsen, and Roman Linskens; sister, Geraldine (William) Koch; brother-in-law, Peter Jahner, and sister-in-law, Marie Feist. He is preceded in death by his wife, Anne; son, Dennis; infant daughter, Dianne; parents, John and Barbara; brothers, Joseph, Jerome, and Victor; and sisters, Marian, Therese, Anne, Lucille and Delores. <br/> He grew up on the South side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, attending St. Florian's Catholic School, Greenfield School, Walker Junior H.S. and South Division H.S. John extended his education at Arizona State University, General Motors Institute of Technology, and Milwaukee School of Engineering. John was a member of the Civilian Conservation Corps and advanced to crew chief on his second stint. John proudly served as a boilermaker 1st Class in the U.S. Navy from 1939 to 1945; first aboard the USS Louisville and for the last year aboard the USS Cape Esperance. He continued his service in the U.S. Naval reserve. Having served during peacetime, he had the opportunity of traveling the world extensively on 'good will tours' before WWII started. He passed his love of travel and other cultures to his family. A fascination with aviation may have begun on an aircraft carrier, but continued while working for Goodyear Aircraft in Phoenix. Later on, he was proud to have been a part of the space race working as a Quality Control Engineer at General Motors on guidance systems for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space missions. In Junior High and High School, John participated in track and football and when at home enjoyed the family's passion for tennis as well as ice skating and ski jumping with friends. It was in the CCC and the navy that he developed his passion for baseball which continued while he was in the Navy and later with Goodyear Aircraft. Dad was a catcher and was proud to have gone up to bat against Satchel Paige in an exhibition game in Bremerton, Washington. Satchel burned three pitches past him that he could never have touched. While playing for Goodyear Aircraft, his team was 'wiped' by a former women's professional league team. Great fun! Later on, John took up golfing. He joined the company league and eventually became a scratch golfer and league secretary. When he was a young man, he apprenticed to his father, a builder, and learned carpentry and masonry. He helped build many a home in the South St. Paul area (if you see arched stone entryways - those were his signature work) and in Milwaukee, including homes for his parents and two of his sisters. Finally, after retiring, he built his own cottage in the woods in Pound, Wisconsin. He and Anne spent many happy years in what he called 'God's Country.' <br/> He was a 17 year pancreatic cancer survivor, a caregiver to his wife, and was possessed of a phenomenal energy and facility right up to the end. He led by example; by questioning, by studying, by being a hard worker, and always a gentleman. While John was a very private person, he attracted people nonetheless. He was adopted as 'pa' and 'grandpa Jay' by many and as ' dziadek' by our Polish family. He will be dearly missed by all of us!  <br/> A mass and memorial service will be celebrated later this summer at St. Anne's Catholic Church in Coleman, Wisconsin. In lieu of flowers, John would have preferred everyone to spend their money on their own good causes or on having a good time in his memory (especially at the casino).<br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-767079467378.html">Album :story: </a>767079467378["Grandma Jo Gleason"] 2014-05-01 Obituary<br/>Josephine Gleason, 87, of Williams Bay WI died Wednesday May 1, 2014 at home surrounded by her family.

Mike was born February 18, 1949 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Richard Joseph Linskens and Joanne Louise Steiner. <br/> He is survived by his wife, Dianne and his children, Nicole, Brett (Paulina), Tricia and Michaela; grandchildren Brianna, Sarina and Carina Halvorsen, Roman and Zachary Linskens; Brothers Richard (Gail) and Robert Linskens; Nieces April (Jason) Kaczik (Jonathan, Amber and Justin) , Angel Linskens (Blake, Brandon and Bryce Martin); Sister-in-Law Corinne Yetka and Brother-in-Law Robert (Christy) Yetka (Samantha and Alex). <br/> He is preceded in death by his parents, Richard and Joanne; Father-in-Law, and best friend, John Yetka and Mother-in-Law Anne. <br/> Mike grew up in the Milwaukee area and graduated from Washington High School in 1967, where he was an 'All City Pitcher.' Mike attended UW-Milwaukee and UW-Stevens Point, graduating with a BS in Water Chemistry and a Masters Degree in Environmental Chemistry. Mike and family moved to Madison where he worked at Hazelton Laboratories and went on to become the Laboratory Director at Warzyn Engineering. Mike created Environmental Chemistry Consulting Services (ECCS) in 1991. <br/> Mike was proud of ECCS and the ECCS family that flourished under his original vision in 1991. Many who know and love Mike may include the label 'stubborn,' but in the work sense, that 'stubbornness' was transformed into a company that never settles for the status quo. He wanted a company that was based on educating our clients on a potential solution to do things faster, better, and more efficiently, which went against a lot of the norm in the early years of the environmental cleanup community in which ECCS has and continues to serve. Mike also believed in and lived the concept of owner/operator, and his status as 'owner' was in most regards secondary to his willingness to operate in the trenches – or in this case in the lab – day in and day out right alongside the ECCS family. This is a tenant that Mike lived right up to the very end. Mike was instrumental at creating a special niche in the Agricultural Chemical cleanup program, which was the foundation of ECCS’ early success and a core service area to this very day. Many of the sites ECCS has helped clean up in this venue were located in remote locations throughout the country – many of which were coincidentally located near beautiful trout streams. Mike commonly 'volunteered' to work on many of those sites, not uncommonly bringing his fly rod in tow with the mobile lab! Mike’s legacy at ECCS is strong and he leaves a company that is not only the industry-leader in its field, but one that the ECCS family is proud to be a part of and will continue to flourish in the exact vision that he laid out over 25 years ago.  On a personal note, Mike loved nature in all of its aspects, predicting weather better than the TV meteorologists, and although he achieved 'Life Master' title at bridge, he more recently changed gears to playing on-line poker and slot machines. One reason for this may have been that he likely ran out of bridge playing partners to beat, so poker and slot machines offered a wider field to tackle. He loved sports and watching the teams he grew up with: Brewers, Packers and Bucks. Along with baseball he had a killer jump shot and before a game would always shoot 10 free throws. He was automatic hitting at least 8 out of 10 every time. You could often find him shooting hoops in the driveway, playing with the family and schooling his grandkids. To celebrate Mike's life, a gathering will be held at Good Shepherd Catholic Church at its Saint Joseph Site, located at 1905 W Beltline Hwy. (off of Fish Hatchery Road) on Wednesday, July 1st from 5-8 PM. Dinner will be provided. A memorial service will be held at Mike's favorite fly fishing spot on the Peshtigo River later this summer. In lieu of flowers please help further Mike's efforts by contributing, in his name, to a conservation cause of your choosing. He would appreciate efforts to making this world a better environment for our future generations.

He was a rock for us all! He will be dearly missed! <br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-332587440678.html">Album :story: </a>332587440678["Roy Jacobsen"] 2015-02-24 Obituary<br/>Roy Jacobsen passed away Tues., Feb. 24, 2015 age 85.<br/>Beloved husband of Donna (nee Akins).

I believe Alice and Mayme both died in 1910 of diptheria. So if John is the oldest, it would make sense if John was standing in back, about 17, making the picture date be about 1896.

I don't recall what his mother Maiden name was.  Sorry.  Aunt Shirley may recollect that.  Some place along the line I was told they were Latter Day Saints - Mormons.

He lost one of his eyes from a steel chip that came off while driving a rail spike, so the story goes as I recollect it.<br>Some day maybe one of us can check out the family genealogy.

Been wondering how things are going. How Judy is doing and how you are. <br/>I saw Larry for a couple of hours when he came to visit Shirley. He had been to visit you first.<br/>Did you do anything special for Thanksgiving? Have you seen Jemma lately? Any special plans for Christmas? <br/>Tom and I visited our grandkids (and their parents) for a couple of days during the week before Thanksgiving. He helps a friend at a Christmas Tree farm in Oconto county every year. They open for sales the day after Thanksgiving and he is there every day until Christmas. <br/>We are planning another short visit to the kids for Christmas. The youngest, Elise, will be 4 years old on Christmas Eve. We try to be there for each one's birthday and with hers, we get Christmas, too!<br/>Emma was 9 in August. I think she is close to Jemma's age. Lizzie turned 6 in October. She got hearing aids in September and has taken total responsibility for their care and maintenance. <br/>We really enjoy the time we spend with them. We are so lucky to have our health yet. <br/>Like I said at the beginning, I think about you guys a lot. Wished it were different for you all. Some day we will see the big picture and understand why. <br/>Take care, Jerry. Hugs to you and Judy.<br/>Betty <br><a href="./html-for-sets-of-photos/story-425084210025.html">Album :story: </a>425084210025["Jemma Jacobsen"] 2010-03-23 Grandparents' day at Jemma's school. This is Jemmas teacher.  From: sheila cronin <sheilamariecronin@gmail.com> Date: March 25, 2010 9:04:04 AM CDT To: jerrold jacobsen <jerrold.j.jacobsen@gmail.com> Subject: Re: Grandparents day at Jemma's school  [The teacher's name is] Mrs. Maryann Renwick, We really lucked out with her. She is fabulous. When Jeremy and I made our first site visit to the school we where invited to visit each class quietly and walk around. In her room we found a cute Indian girl reading a book out loud to 3 others, she was sitting in the rocking chair. We where so amazed she seemed so aware. She was only 5 and it was so hard to imagine that your kid, who barely began speaking could be reading in 2 years?! We also saw  the kids turned on by the Montessori math bars and doing number jobs. Very focused, and not chaotic in the least bit. Seemed so magical.  The method is very powerful and I know you had to leave before clean up but they end the day with clean up. Everyone puts away their jobs. Then line time for a song and book which they all love and seem so young and dear in the way they participate. They single out 3 kids and they go do the dishes near the snack area; wash the plates, dry and put away. They sweep and dust and pour giant buckets of water into a bigger bucket.They rarely spill a drop, if they do, they have more to clean up. Its so interesting to watch them work. Such capacity. I am so happy we started her at that school when she was 18 months old, it has made a tremendous impact on her love of learning.  Thanks for coming down, she was so very excited to show you. And you got to see our nature center, that still ranks as one of my favorite jobs in life. Jemma said she wants to work there with me when she is older!

The complete transcript can be obtained from the Museum's website.<br/>John Yetka describes his personal experiences while in Navy service before and during World War II as engineer aboard the USS Louisville and the USS Cape Esperance and subsequent work experiences in Wisconsin following the war.  Yetka, growing up in Milwaukee during the depression years, rose to senior foreman in Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) before joining the Navy in 1939 (following in his brother’s footsteps).  He attended basic training at the Great Lakes Training Center prior to assignment on the Louisville as an engineer in the 'black gang.'  Yetka touches upon Louisville’s goodwill cruise to Recife (Brazil) and Montevideo (Uruguay) in time to see the USS Graf Spee scuttled.  Following a mission carrying gold and platinum bullion from South Africa to New York, Yetka’s brother came on board the Louisville prior to shipping out to the Philippines.  Yetka reflects on providing escort for civilian transport ships from Philippines to American Samoa while not knowing that Pearl Harbor had been bombed.  Yetka speaks of their surprise returning to Pearl Harbor and the people’s joy on seeing them.  After a refit in the States, Yetka mentions his experience at the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Louisville being hit with a dud torpedo in the fire-room and standing watch as the torpedo bounced around while returning to Hawaii.  He talks about Japanese activity in New Guinea and some boiler work he did for the British cruiser Sydney before the Louisville was sent to the Aleutian Islands to close the channel (sinking all Japanese ships and transports) and his thoughts on the Tarawa (Gilbert Islands) Assault.  Yetka mentions his transfer to the USS Cape Esperance, encountering a storm that sunk escorts and destroyers, how Cape Esperance’s commander was a southern bully only thinking of Dixie, and Yetka’s reaction to the Japanese surrender.  When on Mare Island (California), Yetka saw a sign on a civilian residence reading, 'Sailors and dogs, keep off,' after which he mentions his impression of Americans at that time.  After his discharge in 1945 at Walt Chamberlain Field (Minnesota), Yetka describes subsequent work with the Conservation Department, Goodyear Aircraft and General Motors where he gave the final approval for the mechanical portion of the guidance system used on the Apollo spacecraft.  He concludes the interview mentioning additional anecdotes about the Louisville’s history, naval family life and his family.<br><a href="./html-for-each-photo/1.html">Photo 1: </a>["Les Jacobsen"]
